github pages of rendered hanabi-react


//for my reference.. there should be no real reason to clone this repo.. it is only for the github pages url
//so I don't have to go to https://charliewynn/github.io/hanabi-react/build/index.html
with charliewynn/hanabi-react cloned, and in the main folder, delete the build directory.
then git clone https://github.com/charliewynn/hanabi build
npm run build
